Delegator allows you to have infinite openid identities.

%h2 How it works

A step-by-step guide:
%ul
  %li Get an invitation
  %li Register a new account
  %li Pickup an alias and associate a real openid identity to it
  %li Use _http://delegator_url/openid/alias_ as openid identity.
  %li Get infinite openid identities using the following url:_http://delegator_url/openid/alias+a_number_

%h3 A small example

Suppose you registered the alias '_foo_'
The following urls are all valid openid identities:
%ul
  %li _http://delegator_url/openid/foo_
  %li _http://delegator_url/openid/foo+1_
  %li _http://delegator_url/openid/foo+2_
  %li ... and so on...
